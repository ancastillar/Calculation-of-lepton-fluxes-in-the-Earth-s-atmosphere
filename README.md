## Abstract

When the primary cosmic rays enter Earth’s atmosphere and interact whit
the air nuclei, they produce several amounts of the secondary particles.
Some of these particles are not absorbed in the atmosphere, such as muons
and neutrinos. This way, from the spectra of each secondary particle, we
can obtain information about the primary cosmic rays and their physical
interactions through the atmosphere. In the present work, we solve the
coupled Cascade equations numerically with MCEq code. The presented
approach is very flexible and allows the use of different hadronic interaction
models, realistic parametrizations of the primary cosmic-ray flux and the
Earth’s atmosphere, and a detailed treatment of particle interactions and
decays. Finally, we study in detail the seasonal variation of atmospheric
muons at very high energy.
